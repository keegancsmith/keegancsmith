Site
====

This site is a bunch of `ReStructuredText
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ [`src <_sources>`_] which are
processed into HTML files by `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_. The source
of this site is available on `GitHub
<https://github.com/keegancsmith/keegancsmith>`_.

A great artist is good at hiding his sources. I am not a great designer so
here is a list of sites I got inspiration from:

* `Instapaper's Text View <http://www.instapaper.com/>`_
* `Readability Bookmarklet <https://www.readability.com/bookmarklets>`_
* `Steve Losh <http://stevelosh.com/blog/>`_
* `Armin Ronacher <http://lucumr.pocoo.org/>`_
* `Ryan Tomayko <http://tomayko.com/>`_
