Description
===========

A plugin for Amarok 1 and 2 that updates your Pidgin status message with what
you are currently listening to.

If you want to update your Gaim status message, look for the AmarokGaim
package.


Dependencies
============

* Amarok (Tested on Amarok 1.4.10 or Amarok 2.0-SVN-Neon Jan 14 2009)
* Pidgin with D-Bus support (Tested on Pidgin 2.5.2)
* Python with D-Bus support (Tested on Python 2.5.2 (Should also work with
  Python 2.4))
* DCOP client (If using Amarok 1. Tested on KDE 3.5.10)
* Optionally depends on chardet for better character
  decoding. [http://chardet.feedparser.org/]


Configuration
=============

* Supported variables in **STATUS_MESSAGE** are:

  - $album
  - $artist
  - $genre
  - $title
  - $track
  - $year
  - $nowPlaying
  - $lyricsURL
  - $lyrics
  - $rating
  - $score

* *$lyrics* variable displays a single line from the lyrics of the song. The
  lyrics must be fetched by Amarok first.
* More configuartion options can be found in *AmarokPidgin.ini*, which can be
  found in *~/.kde/share/apps/amarok/scripts-data/*
* To edit the list of expletives edit *censor_words* in
  *AmarokPidgin.ini*. Words are | separated


Variable Map
============

All variables that go in the **STATUS_MESSAGE** can now be filtered by a user
supplied function. This is done using the configuration options
**variable_map** and **variable_imports**. **variable_map** is a function
which accepts 2 strings (Variable, Value) and returns a
string. **variable_imports** runs possible imports required for
**variable_map**.

Examples
--------

* Quote ::

   variable_map = lambda x,y : y and ("'"+y+"'") or ''

* Unknown String ::

   variable_map = lambda x,y : y or ("Unknown " + x.capitalize())

* iPodify strings ::

   variable_map = lambda x,y : ' '.join(['i' + s.capitalize() for s in y.split()])


Amarok 2
========

AmarokPidgin now has rudimentary Amarok 2 support. It does not support many of
the variables, updating your buddy icon and configuration from Amarok. To
configure you have to edit *AmarokPidgin.ini*, which can be found in
*~/.kde/share/apps/amarok/scripts/AmarokPidgin*.
