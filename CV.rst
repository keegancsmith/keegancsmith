Employment History
==================

* **2015 to current** - Software Engineer at `Sourcegraph
  <https://sourcegraph.com/>`_.

* **2012 to 2015** - Software Engineer at `Facebook
  <https://www.facebook.com/>`_. Worked in the Developer Infrastructure
  org. Main projects were scaling `Continuous Integration
  <https://www.facebook.com/keegan.csmith/posts/10155567301170227>`_ (from
  hundreds to thousands of machines), developer workflow improvements
  (innovation around tooling/automation for working in large codebases) and
  mobile automated end to end testing infrastructure (part of automating the
  mobile release process). Technologies used: Hack, PHP, Python, Chef,
  Phabricator and many fb internal tools.

* **2012** - Contract work `Snapbill <http://snapbill.com/>`_. Technologies

* **2011** - Internship at `Nimbula <http://nimbula.com/>`_. Wrote an EC2 API
  Shim. This was a service which exposed an EC2 SOAP and REST API and
  translated the requests into Nimbula Director API requests. Technologies
  used: Python and Twisted.

* **2010** - Internship at `Amazon Web Services <http://aws.amazon.com/>`_ on
  the EC2 Team. My first project was replacing an internal XML-RPC system with
  something faster (ended up being JSON). The second project was creating a
  distributed monitoring system of the EC2 API, which alarms on elevated
  failure rates. Technologies used: Java, Python and EC2.

* **2008** - Contracting work at `CareerJunction
  <http://www.careerjunction.co.za/>`_ as a Junior Python Developer. Wrote a

  Town.  The Python course is a course for above average students, that
  already know how to program in Java. Topics covered: Python Syntax and Data
  Type, UML, Unit Testing, Regular Expressions and Functional Programming.

* **2006** - Two internships at Standard Bank. I was a bursary student, but
  discontinued the bursary to look for more interesting opportunities. I did
  work in C# and Java. C# work was a basic front-end to a SQL database. The
  Java work was Servlets for another database. Another project that I worked
  on was a Java servlet that generated a graph of the dependencies between
  Oracle databases.
